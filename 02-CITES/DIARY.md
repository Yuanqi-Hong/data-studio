Illustrator tricks learned through this project:  
- If the chart is too long, upon open you can't move it around. Ai CC 2018 has a limit of art boart height (and width maybe) of 16383 pixels. If the image is larger than that, you first have to resize (transform) it to let it fit in the limit. A good thing about vector images is that you can resize to super small, and when put on the web, it automatically resize itself to fit the page width and still remains sharp.

HTML tricks learned:  
	- There are 2 ways of using svg in html. The first is using it in an image tag like this:
	`<img src="filepath">`; the second is using it inline, copy-paste the code directly to html. The difference is that, A, the first method makes the html code look much simpler and makes it easier to update, and B, the first method will render the entire image to be an image, meaning you can't select or search the text like you could with inline svg.
